# ðŸš€ Automated Docker Deployment Script

This repository contains a **production-grade Bash script (`deploy.sh`)** that automates the **setup, deployment, and configuration** of a **Dockerized application** on a **remote Linux server** (e.g., AWS EC2).  

Itâ€™s designed to mirror real-world DevOps workflows â€” from infrastructure provisioning and application setup to deployment validation and rollback â€” all in **one automated pipeline**.

## ðŸ§© **Why This Project Exists**

Modern DevOps teams strive for **automation, reproducibility, and reliability**.  
Instead of manually SSH-ing into servers, installing dependencies, and running containers by hand, this script:

- Automatically installs and configures Docker, Docker Compose, and Nginx.
- Clones your GitHub repo securely using a Personal Access Token (PAT).
- Deploys your containerized app remotely.
- Configures Nginx as a reverse proxy (port 80 â†’ your containerâ€™s port).
- Validates the health of your containers.
- Generates detailed timestamped logs for auditing.
- Supports safe cleanup and redeployment.

Essentially â€” itâ€™s your **one-click CI/CD pipeline**, powered entirely by Bash.
